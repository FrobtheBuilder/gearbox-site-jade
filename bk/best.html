			BEST is a themed robotics competition. 
                The 2012 competition is called WARP XX. The game for Warp XX is to build a robot that will carry objects and cargo up a space elevator. The game is centered around having a robot move up and down a pole delivering items to and from space. This includes changing out fuel, adding a habitation module, and move cargo into the space station.

            <p>Our robot was designed to catch the flies and bug food. It has a six wheel design for stability and mobility while our lengthy arm can extend to the flies and over the obstacles before the containment areas. To improve efficiency we use gears; these gears also reduces stress on the small motors provided by BEST inc. to our team. Overall this produces a sturdy and high scoring robot for the BEST 2011 challenge.</p>
			<p class="para">We placed second in the BEST competition. Our robot named the Stalking Mantis was built to catch flies and place them into the woodpile containment area. This tactic won us over 300 points in one match. We then went on to win the wildcard spot in the competition and won second place overall. </p>
