Under strict rules, limited resources, and time limits, teams of 25 students or more are challenged to raise funds, design a team 'brand,' hone teamwork skills, and build and program robots to perform prescribed tasks against a field of competitors. It is as close to 'real-world engineering' as a student can get. Volunteer professional mentors lend their time and talents to guide each team."</i></p><span style="font-size: smaller">Information from<a href="http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc" target="_blank">FIRST Robotics Competition</a></span><br><p>Dean Kamen, the FIRST founder, created the program "<i></i>to transform our
culture by creating a world where science and technology are
celebrated and where young people dream of becoming science and
technology leaders." FIRST strives for this by "<i>inspiring young
people to be science and technology leaders, by engaging them in
exciting mentor-based programs that build science, engineering and
technology skills, that inspire innovation, and that foster
well-rounded life capabilities including self-confidence,
communication, and leadership.</i>"</p><p>Further FIRST
ideals are gracious professionalism, and coopertition. Gracious
professionalism is the doctrine that emphasizes "<i>high-quality work, emphasizes the value of others, and respects individuals and the community.</i>"
With Coopertition, "<i>fierce competition and mutual gain are not separate notions.</i>"
FIRST defines Coopertition as "<i>displaying unqualified kindness and respect in the face of fierce competition.</i>"</p><p>These two ideals give a brief look at the mindset of FIRST. That mindset is one of fun first. FIRST is a fun competition. You get to see your freinds, make new freinds, and even see old freinds who also participate in FIRST.</p><span style="font-size: smaller">Information found at<a href="http://www.usfirst.org/aboutus/gracious-professionalism" target="_blank"> FIRST's website.</a></span><p>Every spring,<span class="logo">Grady Gearbox Gangstaz Robotics</span>(or G3)
